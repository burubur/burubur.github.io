It is the inevitable drift from order into chaos.</p>\n<p>In software engineering, it manifests as the thermodynamic tax on every line of code you write—a constant, invisible force destructuring the ecosystem you built.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>To move a car, we burn gasoline. We get kinetic energy, but we also produce heat and nitrogen oxides. The waste is the price of the movement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To ship a feature, we burn cognitive energy. We extract focus from the human brain, but we also produce stress and burnout. The wear on the engineer is the price of the code.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"/blog/monoloop\">The Monoloop</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 15, 2026","slug":"/blog/entropy","title":"Entropy"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/entropy"}},
